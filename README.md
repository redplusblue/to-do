## [Click to open](https://redplusblue.github.io/to-do/)

## Features:
1. Can create custom projects with name and description. 
2. Each project can have tasks, which can have a Name, Description, Due Date, and a priority.
3. Your saved tasks/projects stay even on if the browser closes! (if you have localStorage) 

## What I used/learned: 
1. CSS: Animations, Transform, Layout. 
2. JS: Webpack (bundling, dynamic html page creation, development server, `import` , `export`), localStorage, sessionStorage
3. npm, lodash
